In order to run the compiler, run these simple steps while in Ubuntu and the root of the CST-405 folder:

make clean
make
./parser

It will print out the AST tree, symbol table, TAC, and compilation time.

You can then copy the contents of output.asm into MIPS/MARS. From there, press Assemble and then Run.
